SPOJBACKUP is a Python script that helps you take incremental backup of all your
accepted and challenge code submissions on Sphere Online Judge (http://spoj.pl).

Usage is simple - 
	
	$ python ./spojbackup.py -o /disk/code/spoj/mybackup/
	  Enter username : foobar
	  Enter password : ***


Notes - 
	
	* Packaging is yet to be done
	* Support on Windows yet to be done
	* Maybe we can add a tiny UI too, if at all needed
